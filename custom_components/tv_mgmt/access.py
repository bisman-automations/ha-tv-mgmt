"""Who may use TV Mgmt: admins, plus the parents an admin picks.

The same rule covers the sidebar app, its websocket API, TV Mgmt's own
switches and mode select, and its services, so a child with a Home Assistant
login can't change their own limits from a regular dashboard either.
Automations and scripts started by Home Assistant itself (no user) are
always allowed.
